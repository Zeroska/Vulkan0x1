#Okay so how to use squid proxy server
1. First of all install it, install squid
    - In ubuntu sudo apt-get install squid
    - And guide your browser IP default gateway to the
    Ip address of the proxy server 
2. Need to edit squid config 
    - search for the http_access
3. restart squid service

Note: chrome use default setting of the Internet Explorer 
Oh what did you know, surprise huh
and the Squid Proxy Server required a good hard disk
which had tremendous Read-Write speed ==> would prefer SSD 
if you wanna build one (CPU is not nessesary)
