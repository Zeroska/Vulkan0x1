WHAT ZEROSKA WANT, NEED:

- I want to create a blog about some educational things and a place to express my emotions 
- Place where I can sing like no one there, Making tutorial 


what should I do now  ? 
- probably focus on the university and improve myself (shit this is cringe)
I actually don't know what to do, to many thought and nothing done yet. I'm have already fail my FE 
shit that was my fault, school ain't any better, friends ??? (I'm guess I have to find something 
that work and do it for the rest of the year[could be something fun? or meet new people]), 
- Why do I keep listening to music and then find it related to me, maybe I need to stop doing that
- I need a PLAN 
- What is the plan for tonight ? go to the cybercafe I guess ? (that's bad ... I don't want it)
-
